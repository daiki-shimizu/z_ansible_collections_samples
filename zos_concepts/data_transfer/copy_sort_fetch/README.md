# Copy, Sort and Fetch Data Sets on z/OS using Ansible

This project provides sample playbooks and roles which is used to demonstrate
how to use many of the common core Ansible modules included in Red Hat Ansible
Certified Content for IBM Z. This playbook copies a local file containing
tabular data to a sequential data set on the remote z/OS system. This data set
is then sorted based on a particular criteria and the sorted data set is fetched
back to the control node. The following core modules are used to accomplish
these set of tasks:

- `zos_copy`
- `zos_find`
- `zos_lineinfile`
- `zos_mvs_raw`
- `zos_fetch`

It is a good practice to review the playbook sample contents before executing
them. It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location,
names, authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.
Although samples are written to operate without the need for the user’s
configuration, flexibility is written into the samples because it is not easy
to determine if a sample has access to the host’s resources. Review the
playbook notes sections for additional details and configuration.

## Ansible Collection Requirement

   IBM z/OS core collection 1.2.0 or later

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with playbooks, you can review our
[detailed configuration guide](../../../docs/share/configuration_guide.md) or
continue with getting started below.

Optionally, you can use the sample
[host_setup](../../../zos_administration/host_setup/README.md)
to discover and create your **inventory** and **host_vars** artifacts. It should
be noted that when you use the **host_setup** it will generate a configuration
for the most common dependencies, some playbooks require more customized
configurations, in this case, you can review the sample documentation and
add the additional required variables.

### Update [inventory.yml](inventory.yml) with the information about your system(s)

```yaml
# the system where the data should be copied to
source_system:
  hosts:
    zos_host:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

### Update the environment variables for each z/OS system in [host_vars/source.yml](host_vars/zos_host.yml)

```yaml
# the path to the root of IBM python installation
PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"

# the path to root of ZOAU installation
ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
```

### Run desired playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml copy-sort-fetch.yml
```
